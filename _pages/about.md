I am working with [Dr. Arya Farahi](https://afarahi.github.io/Our-Team.html) within his [D3 Research Lab](https://afarahi.github.io).
Also, I am working with [Dr Mingyuan Zhou](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io) and his research group.
My research is mainly motivated by real-world problems and using the latest deep learning techniques and generative models to solve them.
