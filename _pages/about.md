About
====
I am a third year PhD Statistics student in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.utexas.edu/directory/nevena-gligic) at The University of Texas at Austin (UT).
My research interests focus on solving real-world problems, in areas such as finance, using advanced machine and statistical learning as well as Bayesian modeling methods.
As of the academic year 23/24, I have been working under the mentorship of [Dr. Arya Farahi](https://afarahi.github.io/Our-Team.html) in his [D3 Research Lab](https://afarahi.github.io).
Also, I have been working with [Dr Mingyuan Zhou](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io) and his research group.
To learn more about my research projects, please visit the Research section of my webpage.

Prior to joining UT, I completed [BSc (Hons.) in Mathematics](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk) from [the University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk) and [MSc in Compuational Finance](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/) from [the University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk). My Master's thesis, titled "Operational Risk Bayes Neural Network", had a goal of identifying what change in operational losses values caused a change in operational risk measures. The project was a collaboration between UCL and Santander Bank UK and was conducted under the mentorship of [Dr Giacomo Livan (UCL)](https://sites.google.com/site/giacomolivan) and [Dr Peter Mitic (Santander Bank UK, UCL)](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/60055-peter-mitic).

Hobbies
====
Outside of research, I enjoy staying active through sports like volleyball, tennis, swimming, running, and working out at the gym. In fact, in Fall 2024 semester, I am part of two Intramural Sports teams, volleyball and soccer. In addition, before starting my undergraduate degree, I played in 1B Croatian Women National League. 

Apart from sports, I also have a passion for cooking and baking.
